## Building Footprint Statistics

### Summary
- Total Images: 1773
- Total Building Footprints: 125153
- Total Polygons in Footprints: 125774
- Difference (polygons - footprints): 621
  (This difference occurs because some building footprints contain multiple polygons)

### Processing Results
- Invalid building footprints: 0 (0.00% of all footprints)
- Zero-height building footprints: 9063 (7.24% of valid footprints)
- Valid building footprints with height: 116090 (92.76% of valid footprints)
- Data loading completed in 2.25 seconds
